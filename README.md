### Hi there, I'm Shi Hao ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Currently on a career break! Looking to:

  1. Build side projects for fun (apps that make my own personal life easier)
  2. Travel (Mostly within SEA, East Asia, and California)
  3. Spend time with loved ones
  4. Finish up [Bradfield's CSI program](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/)
  5. Considering learning ML on my own pace. Thinking of using [Chip](https://huyenchip.com/)'s [online machine learning curriculum](https://huyenchip.com/2019/08/05/free-online-machine-learning-curriculum.html)
  6. Learn how to cook some basic dishes and desserts consistently well

âš¡ Fun facts:

  1. I like to boulder, but am limited due to some injuries. Now doing it as a fun pastime rather than "chasing the next grade".
  2. Am getting my feet wet with DJ-ing, bought a [DDJ-400](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/controller/ddj-400/black/overview/). One of my bucket list items is to perform live for a busy venue!
